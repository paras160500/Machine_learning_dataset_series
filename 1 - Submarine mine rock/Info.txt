So here we have to look the data for sonar and it will tell us either it is stone or a mine

So the things clear first that we have to use logistic regression method 
as there is categorical things so we can use logistic regression model

so below is the pathway of doing the work done

Sonar Data => Data Pre Processing => Train Test Split => Logistic regression

with that Logistic Regression Model => We will predict the new data...

So the prediction will be like Rock (R) or Mine (M)
